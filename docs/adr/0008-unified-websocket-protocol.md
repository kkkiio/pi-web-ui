# ADR 0008: Unified WebSocket Protocol — Single Channel for All Server-Client Interaction

## Status

Proposed

## Context

pi-web-ui currently uses **two communication channels** between the browser frontend and the mirror-server extension:

| Channel | Direction | Content |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **WebSocket** (`/ws`) | Bidirectional | Real-time Pi events (`event`), state snapshots (`mirror_sync`), commands (`prompt`, `abort`, etc.), responses (`response`), and error messages |
| **HTTP** (`/api/*`) | Request/Response | Health check, RPC proxy (same commands as WS), session list, session file loading, session search, file browser, project list/launch |

This dual-channel design has several problems:

1. **Duplication** — The `/api/rpc` endpoint proxies the same commands that WebSocket already handles. The frontend uses `sendWs()` for writes when connected, falling back to `rpc()` (HTTP POST) when disconnected. This creates two code paths for every command.

2. **Inconsistent patterns** — HTTP endpoints each have ad-hoc request/response shapes. WebSocket messages have `type: "event"`, `type: "response"`, `type: "mirror_sync"`, `type: "state"`, and `type: "error"` — five different top-level shapes with no unified envelope.

3. **State coupling** — The frontend's `app.tsx` maintains `connection` state and conditionally chooses `sendWs()` vs `rpc()`. The `rpc()` function is used both as a fallback for disconnected WS and as the primary path for `refreshState()` and `loadSessions()`.

4. **Session history endpoints moot** — Per ADR 0007, session history browsing is being removed. `/api/sessions`, `/api/sessions/:dir/:file`, `/api/search`, and `/api/sessions/switch` will be deleted anyway.

5. **Unnecessary HTTP server complexity** — The HTTP server does three unrelated things (static files, API routes, WebSocket upgrade). With API routes moving to WebSocket, the HTTP server's only remaining job is static file serving + WebSocket upgrade.

## Decision

**WebSocket becomes the single channel for all server-client application communication.** HTTP remains only for initial page load (static files) and WebSocket upgrade.

### Unified Envelope

All WebSocket messages use a single envelope with a `type` discriminator:

```typescript
type WsMessage =
  | WsRequest       // browser → server
  | WsResponse      // server → browser (reply to request)
  | WsEvent         // server → browser (server-initiated)
  | WsError;        // server → browser (protocol error)
```

#### Request (browser → server)

```typescript
interface WsRequest {
  /** "req" discriminates requests from other message types */
  type: "req";
  /** Unique request ID for matching response. Use nanoid or incrementing counter. */
  id: string;
  /** Command name — matches handler name on server side */
  method: string;
  /** Optional params. Undefined if command takes no params. */
  params?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

Examples:
```json
{ "type": "req", "id": "r1", "method": "prompt", "params": { "message": "Hello" } }
{ "type": "req", "id": "r2", "method": "get_state" }
{ "type": "req", "id": "r3", "method": "set_model", "params": { "provider": "anthropic", "modelId": "claude-sonnet-4-5" } }
{ "type": "req", "id": "r4", "method": "navigate_tree", "params": { "entryId": "a1b2c3d4" } }
{ "type": "req", "id": "r5", "method": "get_files", "params": { "path": "/src" } }
{ "type": "req", "id": "r6", "method": "get_git_status" }
{ "type": "req", "id": "r7", "method": "get_git_diff" }
{ "type": "req", "id": "r8", "method": "get_file_content", "params": { "path": "docs/prd/workspace-artifacts.md" } }
```

`get_file_content` supports artifact paths produced by the current session's successful Markdown `edit` / `write` tool calls, including paths outside the git workspace. The response method reads the current file content for display in the read-only `artifact-file` tab.

#### Response (server → browser)

```typescript
interface WsResponse {
  /** "res" discriminates responses from other message types */
  type: "res";
  /** Echoes the request ID for correlation */
  id: string;
  /** true if the method executed successfully */
  ok: boolean;
  /** Result data on success. Omit/undefined on error. */
  result?: unknown;
  /** Error message on failure. Omit/undefined on success. */
  error?: string;
}
```

Examples:
```json
{ "type": "res", "id": "r1", "ok": true }
{ "type": "res", "id": "r2", "ok": true, "result": { "model": {...}, "thinkingLevel": "off" } }
{ "type": "res", "id": "r3", "ok": false, "error": "Model not found" }
```

#### Event (server → browser)

```typescript
interface WsEvent {
  /** "event" discriminates server-initiated events */
  type: "event";
  /** Event name. Pi core events keep their native names; extension events are namespaced. */
  event: string;
  /** Event payload. Shape depends on the event type. */
  payload: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

This preserves ADR 0002's event forwarding principle — the `event` field is the event name and `payload` is the original payload unchanged.

Examples:
```json
{ "type": "event", "event": "agent_start", "payload": {} }
{ "type": "event", "event": "message_start", "payload": { "message": { "role": "assistant", ... } } }
{ "type": "event", "event": "session_tree", "payload": { "newLeafId": "xyz", "oldLeafId": "abc" } }
{ "type": "event", "event": "session_name", "payload": { "name": "New name" } }
```

#### Error (server → browser)

For protocol-level errors (malformed JSON, missing `method`, unknown `type`):

```typescript
interface WsError {
  type: "error";
  /** Related request ID if applicable */
  id?: string;
  /** Error code for machine handling */
  code: string;
  /** Human-readable message */
  message: string;
}
```

### State Sync Event

The current `mirror_sync` type becomes a standard event:

```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "event": "state_sync",
  "payload": {
    "entries": [...],
    "tree": [...],
    "leafId": "abc123",
    "model": {...},
    "thinkingLevel": "off",
    "sessionName": "My session",
    "sessionFile": "/path/to/session.jsonl",
    "isStreaming": false,
    "contextUsage": {...}
  }
}
```

Sent on WebSocket connect (full state snapshot). After `session_tree` or turn
completion events, the browser requests a fresh snapshot with `sync_request`
instead of the extension broadcasting an unsolicited full state update.

Workspace git state is intentionally not part of `state_sync`. The browser asks
for it with `get_git_status` when connection, sync, tool, or turn events imply
the workspace may have changed.

### RPC Method Registry

All current commands become methods under the unified `req`/`res` pattern:

| Current Command/HTTP | New Method | Params |
|---------------------|------------|--------|
| `prompt` | `prompt` | `{ message, images?, streamingBehavior? }` |
| `steer` | `steer` | `{ message }` |
| `follow_up` | `follow_up` | `{ message }` |
| `abort` | `abort` | — |
| `enter_arch_mode` | `enter_arch_mode` | — |
| `exit_arch_mode` | `exit_arch_mode` | — |
| `get_state` | `get_state` | — |
| `get_messages` | `get_messages` | — |
| `get_available_models` | `get_available_models` | — |
| `set_model` | `set_model` | `{ provider, modelId }` |
| `cycle_model` | `cycle_model` | — |
| `cycle_thinking_level` | `cycle_thinking_level` | — |
| `set_thinking_level` | `set_thinking_level` | `{ level }` |
| `get_session_stats` | `get_session_stats` | — |
| `set_session_name` | `set_session_name` | `{ name }` |
| `set_auto_compaction` | `set_auto_compaction` | `{ enabled }` |
| `compact` | `compact` | — |
| `export_html` | `export_html` | `{ outputPath? }` |
| `mirror_sync_request` | `sync_request` | — |
| `get_auth` | `get_auth` | — |
| `set_auth` | `set_auth` | `{ enabled }` |
| `navigate_tree` | `navigate_tree` | `{ entryId }` |
| `extension_ui_response` | `extension_ui_response` | `{ id, ...response }` |
| `GET /api/health` | `health` | — |
| `GET /api/files` | `get_files` | `{ path? }` |
| `POST /api/open` | `open_file` | `{ filePath }` |
| New | `get_git_status` | — |
| New | `get_git_diff` | `{ path? }` optional file-specific diff |
| New | `get_file_content` | `{ path }` |
| `GET /api/projects` | Deleted (unused in current UI) | — |
| `POST /api/projects/launch` | Deleted (iTerm2-specific) | — |
| `GET /api/sessions` | Deleted (ADR 0007) | — |
| `GET /api/search` | Deleted (ADR 0007) | — |
| `GET /api/sessions/:dir/:file` | Deleted (ADR 0007) | — |
| `POST /api/sessions/switch` | Deleted (ADR 0007) | — |

### Frontend Changes

1. **Single `send()` function** — Replace `sendWs()` + `rpc()` with a single `send(method, params?)` that returns `Promise<WsResponse>`. Internally queues messages when disconnected, sends immediately when connected.

2. **Remove `rpc()` entirely** — All HTTP POST logic removed.

3. **Resilience** — WebSocket reconnect automatically replays queued requests. No fallback to HTTP needed.

4. **`ConnectionState`** simplifies: `"connecting" | "connected" | "disconnected"`. While disconnected, requests queue up and resolve when reconnected.

### Backend Changes

1. **Remove HTTP API routes** — All `/api/*` handlers deleted except:
   - `/ws` WebSocket upgrade (kept)
   - Static file serving (kept)
   - `/api/health` moved to a WS method

2. **Unified command handler** — Current `handleCommand()` adapts to the `req` envelope. The method name maps directly to existing `switch` cases.

3. **Event broadcast** — All events use the `{ type: "event", event, payload }` shape. The current `mirror_sync` type becomes `state_sync` event.

### Migration Path

**Phase 1**: Add new envelope alongside existing format. Server sends both old and new shapes during transition. Frontend adopts new `send()` function but keeps WS-only; HTTP endpoints remain.

**Phase 2**: Frontend fully migrated to new envelope. Remove HTTP API routes. Remove old message shapes from server.

**Phase 3**: Clean up — remove `BrowserCommand`, `BrowserResponse` types, unify server-side handler dispatch.

### Why Not...

#### Why not keep HTTP as fallback?

The fallback path (`rpc()`) already can't work for most commands when the agent is running — `prompt`, `abort`, etc. need an active Pi process. The only commands useful without WebSocket are `health` and `get_state` — both can be WS methods that queued and delivered on reconnect. Removing HTTP simplifies the codebase and eliminates the dual-path testing matrix.

#### Why not SSE for events?

SSE is unidirectional (server → browser). We'd still need a request channel (HTTP POST or WebSocket). Using WebSocket for everything avoids maintaining two protocols.

#### Why not use JSON-RPC 2.0?

Considered. JSON-RPC's `method`/`params`/`id`/`result`/`error` pattern is well-established. However:

- JSON-RPC requires `"jsonrpc": "2.0"` version field (noise)
- JSON-RPC uses `{"code": number, "message": string}` for errors, which adds nesting
- Our `ok` boolean is simpler for the frontend to branch on
- We don't need JSON-RPC's batch or notification semantics

Our custom envelope is isomorphic enough to JSON-RPC that migration later is trivial if needed.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Single communication channel eliminates dual-path bugs
- Unified envelope makes message handling predictable (switch on `type`, then on `method` or `event`)
- Request/response correlation via `id` eliminates the fragile current pattern where responses echo `command` name
- Frontend code simplifies: one `send()` function, no HTTP fallback
- Server code simplifies: remove ~150 lines of HTTP routing

### Negative

- Breaking change — all message shapes change. Requires coordinated frontend + backend update
- During WebSocket reconnect, requests are queued in memory (browser tab). If tab is closed, queued requests are lost (acceptable — Pi session continues in terminal)
- Health check requires WebSocket connection (minor — page won't load without WS anyway)

### Neutral

- The `state` type (with `advancedFeatures` and `archAvailable`) is folded into the `state_sync` event payload
- Error reporting becomes more structured with error codes
